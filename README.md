## Design Decisions
- **Frontend**: Designed a simple and intuitive user interface using React.js and Bootstrap to enhance user experience.
- **Backend**: Implemented a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Database**: Utilized MongoDB to store product data, providing flexibility and scalability for future enhancements.
- **Challenges**: Faced challenges in handling asynchronous operations and managing state in React components. Overcame them by using useEffect hook for fetching data and managing state effectively.

## Future Improvements
- Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access.
- Add functionality for users to add products to their cart and make purchases.
- Enhance the design with more interactive features and animations.
- implement barcodeScanner to scan the products to directly add to the cart.
- below is the reference code for using quagga API, you can also find it in the barcodeScanner.js in components section. 
  ```sh
